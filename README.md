# CVE Exploits & Security Research

This repository contains **original proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits** for vulnerabilities discovered and responsibly disclosed by the author.  
Each exploit is associated with a **valid CVE identifier** and demonstrates **real-world impact** in a controlled and reproducible manner.

The goal of this repository is to help **security researchers, defenders, and engineers** understand how vulnerabilities are practically exploited, beyond theoretical descriptions found in advisories.
